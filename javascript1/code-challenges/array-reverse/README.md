## Approach & Efficiency
The approach I took was writing down the stuff I did know and then figuring out the solution first. I know it sounds backwards, but solving it first helps me explain how to solve it. I know it might not be the right way, or it would be simpler to do it the other way around. And then I followed the Demo that David did.
