# Collection: linked-list-kth

### Challenge

- Write the following methods for the Linked List class:
- append arguments: new value
  - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- insert before
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- insert after
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach & Efficiency

- I worked with another classmate on this. But It took my awhile to see the patterns of the previous test and built off that.
