# Collection: linked-list-kth


### Challenge 
- Write the following method for the Linked List class: kth from end argument: a number, k, as a parameter. Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list. You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.


## Approach & Efficiency

- I used the previous code challenges to help me through is. I found a really good resource on [Geeks-for-Geeks] <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/> for some guidance on where to start. I had a lot of help from other classmates!
