# Collection: linked-list-zip

### Challenge
- Write a function called zip lists
  - Arguments: 2 linked lists
  - Return: New Linked List, zipped as noted below
  - Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.
  - Try and keep additional space down to O(1)
  - You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Whiteboard
- still working on building this out.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Talked it out with another classmate to understand what the task was asking about, I did had to ask a TA for some guideance because i kept getting a weird error with 'zip'. but once I figured it out i was able to get the test to pass.
