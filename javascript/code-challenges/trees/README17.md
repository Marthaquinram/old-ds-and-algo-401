# Trees

A tree is a collection of nodes connected by some edges. A tree is a non linear data structure. A Binary Search tree is a binary tree in which nodes that have lesser value are stored on the left while the nodes with a higher value are stored at the right. - [geeksforgeeks] <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-binary-search-tree-javascript/>

## Challenge

CC17 - Write a function called breadth first
Arguments: tree
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered
NOTE: Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach

## Approach & Efficiency

- I had to understand what was happening first and then worked with team to code it and used resources from google.
Speaking with Tony helped me get a better understanding of how the BST and BT are working, seeing it visually makes sense.


## Starting up
To run the test, do npm test breadth.test.js
