# Trees
A tree is a collection of nodes connected by some edges. A tree is a non linear data structure. A Binary Search tree is a binary tree in which nodes that have lesser value are stored on the left while the nodes with a higher value are stored at the right. - [geeksforgeeks] <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-binary-search-tree-javascript/>

## Challenge
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

## Approach & Efficiency
- David went over Pre Order code, Danny and I worked together to get inOrder and postOrder.

## Collaborators
 - Danny C.
