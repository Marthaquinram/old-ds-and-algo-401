## Approach & Efficiency

- Tony and I were partnered up for this code challenge, and we started with the problem domain first and what the question was asking us. from there we built out the visualization for how it was going to work then wrote the pseudo code for it, Coded, Big O and went over the trace/walk through for it. We went over explaining how the code works line by line.
